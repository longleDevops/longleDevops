- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Long who is currently a senior-year student at Central Washington Univeristy. I love working on full-stack application from designing the user interface to implementing backend logic of an application. I could spend endless hours working and deloping cool features of an app such as intergrading AI or improving backend logic and performance.
